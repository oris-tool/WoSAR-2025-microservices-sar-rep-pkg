It contains the implementation of the models and all the material required for replicating the study, including: 
xpn files, the corresponding Java classes along with the code to execute the experiment proposed in the paper, and finally the scripts to display the results.

## Oris Models

The Oris models used for the experimentation are available [here](multi-endpoint-sar/models).

## Java code and results

The source code for the experimentation is available [here](multi-endpoint-sar/src/main/java/it/unifi/dinfo/stlab) while the scripts to display the results are available [here](multi-endpoint-sar/scripts).
